<details open><summary><strong>Python 2 or Python 3?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python 3.6

<details open><summary><strong>What is the best way to use it?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep the text file open on separate desktop at all times. It is also in a different text editor than the one I usually use, so it's easier to switch to with '⌘↹' / 'Ctrl+↹'. Cheatsheet consists of minimal text and short examples so things are easy to find with '⌘F' / 'Ctrl+F'.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I keep the Python console open at all times, to test a little snippets of code, to check out the available functions of a module using code completion and above all, to use 'help(&lt;module/object/function&gt;)' command. If something is still unclear, then I search the Python docs by googling 'python docs <module/function>'.

<details open><summary><strong>Why doesn't page load if JavaScript is disabled?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JavaScript is used to convert README.md file to HTML every time the page is accessed. I will make the page static in the future.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why the '&lt;type&gt;' semantics?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes examples much less ambiguous.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>What about PEP 8?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google style guide</a> and use 'Ctrl+Alt+L' / '⌥⌘L' shortcut in PyCharm to automatically reformat code.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why are import statement, virtual environment, tests, packaging and installation not covered?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they will be in the future, or I will make a separate cheatsheet about features important for the production.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why is Asyncio not covered?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's coming soon.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why are there no concrete Regex examples?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same reason as why are there no SQL examples; They are both separate concepts that are independent of Python and both have a ton of resources available online.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>What is a '&lt;view&gt;' in dictionary section?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's one of dict_keys / dict_values / dict_items special objects, that reflects changes in the dictionary and are iterable, but not indexable.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why is there no old style string formating?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it's redundant and I don't want to encourage its use.
