<details open><summary><strong>Python 2 or Python 3?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python 3.6 (Except for Dataclasses that require version 3.7)
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>What is the best way to use it?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep the text file open on separate desktop at all times. It is also in a different text editor than the one I usually use, so it's easier to switch to with <code>Ctrl+↹</code> / <code>⌘↹</code>. Cheatsheet consists of minimal text and short examples so things are easy to find with <code>Ctrl+F</code> / <code>⌘F</code>.<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also keep the Python console open at all times, to test a little snippets of code, to check out the available functions of a module using code completion and above all, to use <code>help(&lt;module/object/function/type&gt;)</code> command. If something is still unclear, then I search the Python docs by googling <code>'python docs &lt;module/function&gt;'</code>.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why the '&lt;type&gt;' semantics?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes examples much less ambiguous.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>What about PEP 8?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check out <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html">Google Style Guide</a> and use <code>Ctrl+Alt+L</code> / <code>⌥⌘L</code> shortcut in PyCharm to automatically reformat code.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why are import statement, virtual environment, tests, packaging and installation not covered?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they will be in the future, or I will make a separate cheatsheet about features important for the production.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why is Asyncio not covered?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's coming soon.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why are there no concrete Regex examples?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same reason as why are there no SQL examples; They are both separate concepts that are independent of Python and both have a ton of resources available online.
</details><br>

<details open><summary><strong>Why is there no old style string formating?</strong></summary><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it's redundant and I don't want to encourage its use.
